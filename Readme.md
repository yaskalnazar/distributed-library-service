Spent time:

    Task 1: 5h 
        (Task 2 was completed first)
        Just basic UI with books Table; And full CRUD REST API for Books entity. 
        

    Task 2: 2h
        Model + Repository + Initial data load by Liquibase.

    Task 3: 4h for basic login + registration
        1h spend for unsuccessful attemp to integrate with Google oauth2.


Notes:
- ChatGPT cannot use latest spring-security 6.0.2 because its base is formed on data until 2021. I had to spend time dealing with deprecated classes.
- ChatGPT invented a non-existent GoogleOAuth2UserService and constantly tries to use it. He was unable to write even an approximately working solution for integration with Google.
