Notes:
- ChatGPT cannot use latest spring-security 6.0.2 because its base is formed on data until 2021. I had to spend time dealing with deprecated classes.
- ChatGPT invented a non-existent GoogleOAuth2UserService and constantly tries to use it. He was unable to write even an approximately working solution for integration with Google.
- ChatGPT helped to quickly write forms and methods for task 4 but often lost or made up variables, so it's worth keeping a close eye on it or always providing a list of variables.
